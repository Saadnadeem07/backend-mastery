// Utility for uploading a locally saved file to Cloudinary
// -------------------------------------------------------
// This module takes a file that already exists on the server‚Äôs local filesystem
// (e.g., after a user uploads through Multer) and uploads it to Cloudinary‚Äôs
// managed storage/CDN. After a successful upload, the file is accessible
// globally via the returned secure URL.

import { v2 as cloudinary } from "cloudinary";
import fs from "fs";

// ‚úÖ Configure the Cloudinary client with credentials stored in environment variables.
//    These values should be set in your .env file to keep secrets out of source control.
cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});

// Uploads a local file to Cloudinary and returns the full Cloudinary response object.
// Workflow:
// 1. Verify that a file path exists.
// 2. Call Cloudinary‚Äôs uploader with `resource_type: "auto"` so it detects the file type
//    (image, video, etc.) automatically.
// 3. If successful, return the Cloudinary response (includes secure URL, public_id, etc.).
// 4. If an error occurs, remove the temporary local file to free disk space and return null.
